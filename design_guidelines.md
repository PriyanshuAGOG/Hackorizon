# CODEVEDANS — RIET Hackathon Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach:** Cyberpunk-inspired digital art style with modern poster design aesthetics blended with hacker culture

## Core Theme & Aesthetic
- **Theme:** "Blast Off into Coding!" - Ultra-modern cyberpunk digital art
- **Color Philosophy:** Dark mode native with neon accents (orange, gold), metallic treatments
- **Ethos:** Innovation, collaboration, energy, creative spirit
- **Background:** Deep black canvas with textured circuit board patterns, faint glowing constellations, animated LED points simulating live "code signals"

## Typography
- **Font Fusion:** Premium serif/sans-serif hybrid inspired by modern poster design
- **Hero Text:** Massive "CODEVEDANS" with glitch-reveal animation, gold shimmer on hover
- **Headers:** Small caps for "Presented By" bars, spaced-out lettering
- **Body Text:** Gray-on-black, premium font, 1.2 line height for information blocks
- **CTAs:** Bold, orange neon headlines with animated shine effects

## Layout System
- **Spacing:** Consistent with circuit trace patterns as visual guides
- **Grid Structure:** Modular 3D glass card grids for features, alternating layouts for variety
- **Parallax Layers:** Stars, circuits, planets with vertical scrolling motion
- **Section Flow:** Hero → Features → Tracks → Schedule → Speakers → Prizes → Sponsors → Registration → Gallery → Community → Contact/Footer
